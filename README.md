# CCFD

This credit card fraud detection project, developed in Python using Jupyter Notebook, aims to identify fraudulent transactions by comparing the performance of four machine learning algorithms: AdaBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. The project evaluates these algorithms based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores to determine the most effective model for detecting credit card fraud.
